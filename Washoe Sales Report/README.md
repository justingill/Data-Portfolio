## Description
This is an in-depth analysis of residential homes in Washoe County using the 2017 Washoe County Sales Report from the Washoe County website. We will use a subset of the Sales Report to look at residential housing and determine housing sales, prices, locality, space, and other insightful information. This project also uses sklearn to create a linear regression model that predicts housing prices for Washoe County.
